# CarInsuranceMVC
Step 213 Application

I had a lot of fun with this project. We were tasked with creating a site where a user could get a quote for car insurance. To add to the challenge, we were given a of specifications to determine the quote amount. This is really my first exposure to MVC architecture - if I were to go back and rewrite this application, I would definitely add more features to make it a more interactive experience. As it is, though, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish, and I think it showcases how I like to have fun with design.
